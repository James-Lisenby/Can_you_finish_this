Project for a random bad movie generator.

As a movie watcher who wants a random bad movie to watch,

I want to click a "random" button that when clicked, will display a list of "x" number of movies in a list.

<!-- When I select a movie, I also want a link to the lead actors wikipedia/IMBD profile page. -->
<!-- When I select a movie, I also want a random quote in no way related to the movie. -->

I also want to be able to check a list of prefrence box's that narrow down the terrible movie search results.
I also want to be able to save a list of movies to watch to "local storage" as well as a button to remove movies from the list.

It is done when the results are displayed on the screen. One spot for results list, a list of a "saved movies" , and a spot for the "currently undecided topic"

<!-- Discloser, these quotes are totaly not based on anything real. -->
<!-- Possibly find a quote that shares one or more words with the title. -->
