# Can You Finish This?

Sometimes, we get tired of watching all these so-called "good" or "popular" movies. We want to break the mould and buck everyone else's opinions. Or maybe we want to watch something that is "so bad it's good". This is a website for exactly that function!

Can You Finish This? is a great way to find new (and bad) movies to broaden your horizons and maybe enjoy some of the depths of modern filmmaking. 

## Description

This website uses The Movie Database API to generate a selection of unpopular films, pulls an unrelated review from the New York Times Movie Review API (for those who like to feel classy while choosing their bad movie) and allows users to save random movies that look promising to a list in local storage.
